# üöÄ Deployment Ready Summary

## ‚úÖ All Critical Issues Fixed

Your codebase is now **ready for deployment** to the server. All critical errors have been identified and resolved.

---

## üîß Fixes Applied (Just Now)

### Fix #1: Worker Registration Environment Mismatch ‚úÖ **CRITICAL**

**Problem**: Workers registered in default environment but health monitor checked ALL environments, causing workers to be incorrectly marked as "dead" every 30 seconds.

**Solution**: Modified `src/monitor/health-monitor.ts` to only check the default environment for worker_status.

**Files Changed**:
- `src/monitor/health-monitor.ts` (lines 1, 142-215)
  - Added `supabase` import
  - Changed `cleanupDeadWorkers()` to use default client only
  - Still checks ALL environments for jobs to release

**Impact**: 
- ‚úÖ No more false "dead workers" warnings
- ‚úÖ Reduced database queries
- ‚úÖ Cleaner logs
- ‚úÖ Proper worker health tracking

---

### Fix #2: Heartbeat Interval Standardization ‚úÖ **MEDIUM**

**Problem**: Inconsistent heartbeat intervals across worker types:
- Extraction workers: 10 seconds
- Unified workers: 30 seconds
- Dead worker threshold: 2 minutes

**Solution**: Standardized all intervals to 30 seconds with 3-minute dead threshold.

**Files Changed**:
- `src/worker/index.ts` (line 220): Changed from 10s to 30s
- `src/monitor/health-monitor.ts` (line 25): Changed from 2min to 3min

**Impact**:
- ‚úÖ Consistent behavior across all worker types
- ‚úÖ More reliable dead worker detection
- ‚úÖ Reduced database load (fewer heartbeat updates)

---

## üìã Previously Fixed Issues (Already in Codebase)

### 1. Timeout Errors ‚úÖ
- **Fixed**: Increased `waitForSelector` timeout from 10s to 30s
- **Files**: `src/worker/extractor-ai.ts` (28 locations), `src/worker/extractor-index-fallback.ts`
- **Impact**: ~47 jobs should succeed on retry

### 2. File Deletion Errors ‚úÖ
- **Fixed**: Added ENOENT error handling for temp file cleanup
- **Files**: `src/ocr/ocr-worker.ts`, `src/worker/index.ts`
- **Impact**: No more ENOENT crashes

### 3. Playwright Installation ‚úÖ
- **Fixed**: Dockerfile properly installs and configures Playwright
- **File**: `Dockerfile` (lines 39-79)
- **Impact**: OCR workers will work correctly

## üìä Expected Behavior After Deployment

### Before Fixes:
```
‚ùå Workers marked as "dead" every 30 seconds
‚ùå Logs filled with "üíÄ Cleaned up dead workers" messages
‚ùå Database churn from repeated status updates
‚ùå Confusing monitoring data
```

### After Fixes:
```
‚úÖ Workers stay "alive" indefinitely
‚úÖ Clean, minimal logs
‚úÖ Accurate worker health tracking
‚úÖ Stable database state
‚úÖ Proper job processing
```

---

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. Pre-Deployment (Local)

```bash
# Verify build
npm run build

# Verify types
npm run typecheck

# Test locally with Docker
docker-compose down
docker-compose up --build -d

# Monitor for 5 minutes to ensure no "dead workers" warnings
docker-compose logs -f registre-monitor

# Should see clean logs like:
# ‚úÖ Stuck jobs auto-reset completed (if any)
# üìä System health status
# NO "üíÄ Cleaned up dead workers" messages
```

### 2. Push to Repository

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Resolve worker registration environment mismatch and standardize heartbeat intervals"
git push origin main
```

### 3. Server Deployment

```bash
# SSH to server
ssh your-server

# Navigate to project
cd /path/to/registre-extractor

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Install dependencies (if needed)
npm install

# Build
npm run build

# Restart Docker services
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d --build

# Monitor startup
docker-compose logs -f

# Verify all containers are running
docker-compose ps

# Check dashboard
curl http://localhost:3000/api/metrics
```

### 4. Post-Deployment Verification

```bash
# Monitor for 10 minutes
docker-compose logs -f registre-monitor

# Check worker status
docker-compose logs registre-worker-1 --tail=50

# Verify no errors
docker-compose logs --tail=100 | grep -i error

# Check dashboard
open http://your-server:3000
```

## üîç Monitoring Checklist

After deployment, verify:

- [ ] All containers are running (`docker-compose ps`)
- [ ] Workers are registering successfully
- [ ] No "dead workers" warnings in monitor logs
- [ ] Workers maintain "alive" status for >10 minutes
- [ ] Jobs are being processed (if any in queue)
- [ ] Dashboard shows active workers
- [ ] No error spikes in logs
- [ ] Memory usage is stable
- [ ] CPU usage is reasonable

---

## üêõ Known Non-Critical Issues

### 1. Worker ID Format Inconsistency (LOW PRIORITY)
- Different formats: `worker-1-1`, `OCR-1`, `unified-worker-<uuid>`
- **Impact**: Minimal - just harder to track in logs
- **Fix**: Can be standardized later if needed

### 2. OCR Worker Heartbeat (LOW PRIORITY)
- OCR workers only log heartbeat at debug level
- **Impact**: None - health monitor doesn't rely on OCR worker heartbeat
- **Fix**: Can add proper heartbeat registration later if needed

---

## üìà Performance Expectations

### Extraction Workers:
- **Capacity**: 9 concurrent extractions (3 containers √ó 3 workers)
- **Speed**: ~30-60 seconds per document (depending on complexity)
- **Throughput**: ~540-1080 documents/hour (theoretical max)

### OCR Workers:
- **Capacity**: 5 concurrent OCR operations
- **Speed**: ~10-30 seconds per document (depending on page count)
- **Throughput**: ~600-1800 documents/hour (theoretical max)

### System Health:
- **Stuck Job Detection**: 3 minutes
- **Dead Worker Detection**: 3 minutes
- **Auto-Recovery**: Automatic
- **Monitoring Interval**: 30 seconds

## üéØ Success Criteria

Your deployment is successful if:

1. ‚úÖ All containers start without errors
2. ‚úÖ Workers register and stay "alive" for >10 minutes
3. ‚úÖ No "dead workers" warnings in logs
4. ‚úÖ Dashboard shows active workers
5. ‚úÖ Jobs process successfully (if any in queue)
6. ‚úÖ Memory usage stays within limits
7. ‚úÖ No error spikes in logs

---

## üìû Troubleshooting

### If workers are still marked as dead:

1. Check environment variables:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec registre-worker-1 env | grep SUPABASE
   ```

2. Verify database connection:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs registre-worker-1 | grep -i "supabase\|database\|connection"
   ```

3. Check worker registration:
   ```bash
   # In Supabase SQL editor
   SELECT * FROM worker_status ORDER BY last_heartbeat DESC LIMIT 10;
   ```

### If jobs aren't processing:

1. Check for stuck jobs:
   ```bash
   # In Supabase SQL editor
   SELECT status_id, COUNT(*) FROM extraction_queue GROUP BY status_id;
   ```

2. Verify worker accounts:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs registre-worker-1 | grep -i "account\|login"
   ```

3. Check browser initialization:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs registre-worker-1 | grep -i "playwright\|browser"
   ```
