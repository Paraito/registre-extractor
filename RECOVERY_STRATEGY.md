# üîß Registre Extractor Recovery Strategy

**Date**: October 15, 2025  
**Goal**: Restore system to "VERY VERY good" quality from 2-3 weeks ago while keeping OCR functionality

---

## üìä Root Cause Analysis

### Timeline of System Quality

| Period | Status | Key Features |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| **Sept 25 (2b22234, adaa2c4)** | ‚úÖ **VERY GOOD** | IndexFallbackHandler with LLM, Vision analyzer working |
| **Oct 9-13 (fa1dd6e, 760df3d)** | ‚úÖ **EXCELLENT** | OCR added, Claude fallback, Docker deployment |
| **Oct 14 (88f0310, 83ae39a)** | ‚ö†Ô∏è **CLEANUP** | Removed Docker, archived OCR (intended simplification) |
| **Oct 14 (5cf2bd3+)** | ‚ùå **BROKEN** | OCR restored WITHOUT Docker, Playwright not installed |
| **Current** | ‚ùå **BROKEN** | Single worker, Playwright errors, extraction failures |

### What Made It "VERY VERY Good"

1. **Intelligent Fallback System** (Sept 25):
   - `IndexFallbackHandler` with LLM-based cadastre/designation selection
   - OpenAI Vision API for screenshot analysis
   - Multiple retry strategies with smart option matching

2. **Robust OCR Pipeline** (Oct 9-13):
   - Gemini File API for index documents
   - Claude fallback for reliability
   - Acte OCR processor with dual-phase extraction
   - Sanitization for structured output

3. **Proper Infrastructure** (Oct 10):
   - Docker deployment with all dependencies
   - Playwright browsers properly installed
   - Multiple concurrent workers

### What Broke

1. **Playwright Installation Missing**:
   - Docker removed but Playwright system deps not installed on server
   - `npx playwright install chromium` only installs browsers, NOT system libraries
   - Server needs: `npx playwright install-deps chromium`

2. **Single Worker Configuration**:
   - `ecosystem.config.js` has `instances: 1` for registre-worker
   - `.env.example` shows `WORKER_COUNT=1`
   - Lost concurrency that allowed multiple docs simultaneously

3. **Incomplete Cleanup**:
   - OCR system restored but Docker infrastructure not restored
   - Configuration mismatch between deployment method and code expectations

## üéØ Recovery Strategy

### Phase 1: Restore Infrastructure (CRITICAL - Do First)

#### Option A: Restore Docker Deployment (RECOMMENDED)
**Why**: Docker ensures all dependencies are properly installed and isolated

**Steps**:
1. Restore Dockerfile from commit a37ae00
2. Restore docker-compose.yml (if exists in archives)
3. Update deployment to use Docker instead of direct PM2
4. All Playwright dependencies handled automatically

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ Guaranteed working environment
- ‚úÖ All dependencies managed
- ‚úÖ Easier to scale
- ‚úÖ Matches the "very good" period setup

**Cons**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires Docker on server
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Different deployment workflow

#### Option B: Fix PM2 Deployment
**Why**: Keep current deployment method but fix dependencies

**Steps**:
1. SSH to server
2. Run: `npx playwright install-deps chromium`
3. Run: `npx playwright install chromium`
4. Verify: `npx playwright --version`

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ Keep current deployment workflow
- ‚úÖ Simpler if Docker not available

**Cons**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Manual dependency management
- ‚ö†Ô∏è May break on system updates
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Harder to reproduce environment

### Phase 2: Restore Concurrency

#### Fix Worker Configuration

**Current State**:
```javascript
// ecosystem.config.js
{
  name: 'registre-worker',
  script: 'dist/worker/index.js',
  instances: 1,  // ‚ùå ONLY 1 INSTANCE
}
```

**Target State**:
```javascript
{
  name: 'registre-worker',
  script: 'dist/worker/index.js',
  instances: 3,  // ‚úÖ MULTIPLE INSTANCES for concurrency
  exec_mode: 'cluster',  // ‚úÖ Enable cluster mode
}
```

**Environment Variables**:
```bash
# .env
WORKER_COUNT=3  # Number of workers per PM2 instance
WORKER_CONCURRENCY=20  # Jobs per worker (already correct)
```

**Total Concurrency**: 3 instances √ó 3 workers √ó 20 concurrency = 180 potential concurrent jobs

### Phase 3: Verify Core Extraction Quality

#### Ensure Vision Analyzer is Active

**Check**:
- `src/utils/vision-analyzer.ts` exists ‚úÖ
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in .env
- Vision fallback is used in `extractor-ai.ts`

**Verify**:
```typescript
// src/worker/extractor-ai.ts should have:
this.visionAnalyzer = new VisionAnalyzer(config.openai.apiKey);
```

#### Ensure IndexFallbackHandler is Active

**Check**:
- `src/worker/extractor-index-fallback.ts` exists ‚úÖ
- LLM-based cadastre/designation selection is enabled
- Fallback triggers on "inexistante" errors

### Phase 4: Verify OCR System

#### Ensure OCR Workers are Properly Configured

**Current**:
```javascript
// ecosystem.config.js
{
  name: 'registre-ocr',
  script: 'dist/ocr/start-ocr-workers.js',
  instances: 1,
  env: {
    OCR_WORKER_COUNT: 5  // ‚úÖ Good - 5 OCR workers
  }
}
```

**Environment**:
```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=xxx  # Required
CLAUDE_API_KEY=xxx  # For fallback
OCR_PROD=true       # Enable for production
```

## üìà Expected Results After Recovery

### Performance Metrics

| Metric | Before (Broken) | After (Recovered) |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| Concurrent Extractions | 1 | 9-60 (depending on config) |
| Playwright Errors | 100% | 0% |
| Extraction Success Rate | <50% | >95% |
| OCR Processing | Broken | Working with fallback |
| Vision Fallback | Not working | Working |

### System Health Indicators

‚úÖ **Healthy System**:
- PM2 shows all workers online
- No Playwright browser errors
- Jobs move from "En attente" ‚Üí "En traitement" ‚Üí "Complete"
- OCR picks up completed jobs within 10 seconds
- Vision analyzer provides fallback suggestions
- IndexFallbackHandler successfully retries with different options

‚ùå **Unhealthy System** (Current):
- Playwright browser not found errors
- waitForSelector timeouts
- Jobs stuck in "En traitement"
- Single worker processing sequentially

## üîç Debugging Commands

```bash
# Check Playwright installation
npx playwright --version
npx playwright install --dry-run chromium

# Check PM2 status
pm2 list
pm2 logs registre-worker --lines 100
pm2 logs registre-ocr --lines 100

# Check worker processes
ps aux | grep node

# Check database for stuck jobs
# (Run in Supabase SQL editor)
SELECT status_id, COUNT(*) 
FROM extraction_queue 
GROUP BY status_id;

# Check recent errors
SELECT * FROM extraction_queue 
WHERE status_id = 4 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

## üìû Next Steps

**Choose your path and I'll implement it**:

1. **üê≥ Docker Path** (Recommended):
   - I'll restore the Dockerfile
   - Create docker-compose.yml with proper scaling
   - Update deployment documentation

2. **‚ö° PM2 Path** (Faster but less robust):
   - I'll provide server commands to install Playwright deps
   - Update ecosystem.config.js for concurrency
   - Create deployment script

**Which path do you prefer?**
